  <h1>Greetings! My name is Casey Glidewell, and I am a game developer and software programmer located in Washington state! I am transfeminine, and nonbinary! My primary pronouns are She/Her, and They/Them.</h1>

  <h2>
    I have experience in game development primarily using GameMaker Studio, using both GML and flowchart programming. I am a graduate of North Seattle College with an associate of arts degree in communication. I hope to some day enter the games industry in an official capacity with a local small to medium sized game development company.
