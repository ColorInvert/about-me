  <h3>
    Ten of my favorite videogames!
  </h3>
  <p>
    Here's a list of 10 videogames that are deeply meaningful to me. It could be considered a "top 10 list" but as time passes, and my fixations change, this list will too. So as of this moment, here's the games that I hold close to my heart.
    <ol>
      <li>Outer Wilds, and it's expansion, Echoes of the Eye</li>
      <li>Yume Nikki</li>
      <li>Dangan Ronpa V3</li>
      <li>Caves of Qud</li>
      <li>Murasaki Tsurugi</li>
      <li>Noita</li>
      <li>Bad End Theater</li>
      <li>We Know The Devil.</li>
      <li>Timberborn</li>
      <li><a href=https://droqen.itch.io/what-is-that-outside>What Is That Outside</a></li>
    </ol> 

    Outer Wilds is my favorite science fiction story ever told, in any medium, and its story so completely self contained I had no idea how they could possibly make an expansion that is at harmony with what exists. But regardless, somehow, they did.
